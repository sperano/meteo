  Specifies the location in the input JSON file that corresponds
  to a particular node.

  line_number and column_number are 0-based, so you should probably
  add 1 before displaying them to the user.

  line_offset is the byte position in the file where the line
  specified by line_number begins.  This is useful if you want
  to display the line in question, because you can seek directly
  to the beginning of the line in the file.

  For arrays and objects, the position specified is that of the
  open square bracket or open curly brace.  For scalars, the
  position specified is at the end of the scalar.

  j65_node represents a value parsed from the JSON file.

  The node_type is recycled from the j65_event enumeration
  in json65.h.  All event types are legal node types, with
  the exception of J65_END_OBJ and J65_END_ARRAY.  Since
  the tree structure treats objects and arrays as containers
  rather than events, they do not have a separate start and
  end.  Rather, J65_START_OBJ and J65_START_ARRAY are used
  to specify object nodes and array nodes, respectively.

  There are three types of container nodes: J65_START_ARRAY,
  J65_START_OBJ, and J65_KEY.  Array nodes may contain any
  number of children, of any type except J65_KEY.  Object
  nodes may contain any number of children, but they may
  only be of type J65_KEY.  Key nodes must have exactly one
  child, which may be of any type except J65_KEY.

  Every node except the root node has a parent, which is the
  J65_START_ARRAY, J65_START_OBJ, or J65_KEY node which
  contains it.  For the root node, the parent pointer is NULL.

  Container nodes point to their first child.  Each child
  node points to its next sibling via the next pointer.
  The final sibling has a NULL next pointer.

  This structure represents an entire tree of nodes read from

  j65_init_tree(), and then it can be passed as the context
  argument to j65_parse(), with j65_tree_callback() as the
  callback argument.

  Once parsing has completed, the tree will be populated.
  The root pointer points to the root (top-level) node.
  All of the strings contained in the tree (in J65_STRING,
  J65_NUMBER, and J65_KEY nodes) will be interned in the
  strings member.

  Besides the string pool and the root pointer, j65_tree also
  contains a small amount of bookkeeping information used
  by the callback, which is unused once parsing is complete.
